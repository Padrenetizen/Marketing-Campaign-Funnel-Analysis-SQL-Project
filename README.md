# Customer Funnel Analysis using SQL

## Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior using a SQL-based funnel to evaluate campaign acceptance and identify high-value customers based on recency.

## Funnel Stages
1. Total Customers
2. Customers Who Did Not Accept Campaign
3. Customers Who Accepted Campaign
4. High-Value Customers (Recency < 30 days)

## Tools Used
- SQL
- Relational Database

## Key Insights
- A significant portion of customers did not accept the campaign.
- Accepted customers represent a smaller but more engaged segment.
- High-value customers form the most valuable subset of the funnel.

## Notes
- Dataset used: `marketing_campaign`
- Funnel is a segmentation-based funnel, not time-sequential.
